# Scala Berlin Brandenburg Talk/Event Proposals

Welcome to the [Scala Berlin Brandenburg](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/) user group's proposals repo.

If you have a proposal for a talk, please do create an issue on this repo, and we'll facilitate the talk.

Meetings are announced on the [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/). Attendees must RSVP there. Our offline hosts might have more requirements for their on-premise hosted events. 

## Proposals

Proposals should include a title and a short description of the talk, as well as preferred date(s). [See an example proposal](https://github.com/scala-berlin-bb/scala-berlin-talk-proposals/issues/1). 

No sales-pitches, please. Any<sup><b>1</b></sup> topic that is remotely related to Scala is very welcome.  

## Voting

Please vote for talks by :star:/:heart: them.
